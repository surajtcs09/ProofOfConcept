1. Mulpile classes can be written in a single file with the class containing execution starter method(i.e.) as public. 
But, a class cannot be mixed with another type such as enum. It means a class with public specififer must be defined in its own file.

Following program will give compile time error stating "The public type RainbowTest must be defined in its own file"

package learn.enumurations;

enum Rainbow {
	RED("Red",0xff0000), GREEN("Green",0x00ff00), BLUE("Blue", 0x0000ff);
	private String color;
	private int hexCode;
	Rainbow(String color, int hexCode){
		this.color = color;
		this.hexCode = hexCode;
	}
	public static Rainbow get(String inputColor){
		for(Rainbow ewmp: values()){
			if(inputColor.equalsIgnoreCase(ewmp.color)){
				return ewmp;
			}			
		}
		return null;
	}
}

public class RainbowTest{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		
	}
}
