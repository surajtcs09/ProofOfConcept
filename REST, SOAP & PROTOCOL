1. REST is a architecture style but SOAP is a protocol. 

If the protocol is not followed then service will not be created.
Specific rules are like there must be endpoints , all exchanges should be in XML format.

but, REST provides only guidelines to create the REST web service. Guidelines like it should be stateless, cachable etc.

SOAP have its WSDL file which must be create in top down approach.
Top down means first wsdl should be created and then java files should be created using wsimport or wsdltojava.
wsdltojava is provided by apache cxf.

REST has WADL file which does not require to create any java files from it as there is not any protocol followed for its creation.




Protocols means rules for communication. 
If two devices want to communicate with each other, they need to follow some protocols. 

HTTP is synchronous protocol. 

ActiveMQ is asynchronous protocol.
